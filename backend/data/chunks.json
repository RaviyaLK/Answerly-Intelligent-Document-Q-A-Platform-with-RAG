Diagnosis of knee osteoporosis relies heavily on subjective interpretation of X-ray images, leading to late detection \u2022 DEXA scans, the gold standard for diagnosis, are expensive and less accessible for early screening. \u2022 Existing AI models often act as a black boxes, lacking interpretable visualization methods, limiting clinical trust and adoption. (Yen et al. 2024). (Yen et al. 2024). (Chaddad et al. 2023, Liu et al. 2024) Ravindu Yasintha Wijesekara | 20210810 | W1868299 Research Gap \u2022 Lack of interpretability in current AI models for knee osteoporosis diagnosis, which operate as \"black boxes\" and fail to provide clinicians with transparent decision-making insights (Liu et al. 2024, Chaddad et al. 2023) \u2022 Limited exploration of advanced models like EfficientNetB4, which could improve diagnostic accuracy compared to older architectures (e.g., VGG16, ResNet50) but remain understudied. (Talukder et al. 2024) Ravindu Yasintha Wijesekara | 20210810 | W1868299 Concept Map Aim of the Research This research aims to design, develop a higher accurate knee osteoporosis diagnosis system that takes advantage of the X-ray images and latest deep learning approaches based on XAI, hence making the diagnosis precise and interpretable.

Manual X-ray interpretation is subjective. By automating detection and adding explainability, the project bridges the gap between technology and real-world clinical practice quite effectively... \u201d Ravindu Yasintha Wijesekara | 20210810 | W1868299 \u201c...medical imaging diagnosis with AI, and the timing is excellent. Many models focus only on performance without considering clinical applicability but this project try to address both... \u201d \u201c... ensemble model's ability to push accuracy even further than the individual models shows solid experimentation and tuning. This iterative improvement is crucial... \u201d \u201c...Grad-CAM integration is highly appropriate for this kind of application. It transforms the black-box model into something visually understandable...\u201d \u201c...Exploring model ensembling with more diverse CNN architectures could be a good next step...\u201d Contributions & Novelty Research Domain Contributions : \u2022 Introduced a novel ensemble model combining EfficientNetB4 and VGG19 for knee osteoporosis diagnosis. \u2022 First application of this ensemble approach in the domain, achieving superior performance over existing models. \u2022 Integrated XAI techniques (Grad-CAM & LIME) to address the black-box issue, enhancing model transparency Problem Domain Contributions : \u2022 Enabled visual interpretation of predictions for clinicians, improving trust and adoption in real-world settings. \u2022 Bridged the gap between high-accuracy AI models and clinical usability through explainability-focused design. Ravindu Yasintha Wijesekara | 20210810 | W1868299 Limitations & Future Enhancements Limitations: \u2022 Interpretability Limitations: Grad-CAM and LIME offer visual insights but lack pixel-level precision and quantitative validation, limiting clinical reliability. \u2022 Dataset and Environment Constraints: The model was trained and tested on a limited, non-diverse dataset using a single hardware setup, affecting generalizability and real-world testing. Ravindu Yasintha Wijesekara | 20210810 | W1868299 Future Enhancements: \u2022 Dataset & Model Expansion: Incorporate more diverse datasets and explore advanced XAI methods for improved anatomical alignment and clearer visual explanations. \u2022 Clinical & Multimodal Integration: Integrate DEXA scans for multimodal diagnosis and conduct supervised clinical trials for real-world feedback and validation.
